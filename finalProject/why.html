    <section>
      <h3>Business Benefits</h3>
      <p>Businesses that fail to prioritize accessibility in their websites and digital tools risk losing access to a vast market of potential customers with disabilities. Studies have shown that inaccessible websites alienate users who cannot navigate or comprehend the content, directly impacting sales and engagement. By implementing universal design principles, businesses can broaden their customer base, enhance their brand reputation, and create an inclusive user experience that fosters loyalty.</p>

      <h3>Human Rights</h3>
      <p>Access to the internet is increasingly recognized as a fundamental human right. An inaccessible website denies individuals with disabilities the ability to participate fully in digital society, limiting their access to education, employment opportunities, and social engagement. Universal design not only ensures compliance with legal standards but also upholds the principle that everyone deserves equal access to online resources, regardless of their abilities.</p>

      <h3>Practical Applications</h3>
      <p>Incorporating universal design into tools like Zoom, Slack, and Teams ensures that individuals using screen reading software (SRS) or other assistive technologies can effectively navigate and utilize these platforms. By providing accessible layouts and functionality, universal design enhances productivity and inclusion in workplaces and educational environments. Features like keyboard navigation, voice commands, and descriptive alt text can make digital tools usable for everyone.</p>
